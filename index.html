                <span class="text-muted">The importance of local backup.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is an important component of any version control system. Having a local repository allows you to work on a project anywhere, even if there is no internet connection. You would need to push your changes to the remote repository in order to share them with collaborators. A remote repository isn't actually necessary in order to use all the features of Git, but is necessary in order to share with others. If using a local repository, it's important to make sure you're not overwriting somebody else's changes when you commit. Git fetch and git status are useful in accomplishing this.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">A remote repository is even better.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most obvious advantage to a remote repository is that if there is a catastrophe involving your computer, the project is backed up elsewhere. In this age of ransomware and other threats, one's backups should be backed up! The second advantage is that a remote repository allows for sharing and collaboration. Git has many tools and commands to ensure that changes to code are tracked and not inadvertently overwritten. Remote repositories can also be set to read only or read/write. The git remote command is useful for seeing what remote servers you've configured. For remote repositories, you can only push to HTTP or SSH type URLs.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Funny Name, Serious Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git came about in 2005 after Linux developers' lost free access to Bitkeeper, the tool they used for version control. Rather than pay for Bitkeeper access, Linus Torvalds and others developed Git as an open source solution. Torvalds also cited Monotone as an influence in creating Git. Git has become the most commonly used source code management system (even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/microsoft-now-uses-git-and-gvfs-to-develop-windows/">Microsoft</a> uses it to develop Windows!), so I'm glad we're working on it in class. As Git has matured, it's retained and refined the traits that made it the standard, including speed, relative ease of use, simplicity and a branching sytem.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">No matter what, effective communication requires a consistent set of words that everyone understands. Git is no exception. Fortunately there are ample glossaries and tutorials on line. <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">HERE</a> is one very, very extensive list. Git config, git init, git clone, git add and git commit are the most basic commands to get started. They take care of configuring and setting up a repository, copying, adding and saving files. Git status tells you the status of files. Git pull and push move files between local and remote repositories. Git gc and git prune work to clean up a repository and help keep it running efficiently. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What a Treat!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was developed with collaboration in mind. While it has lots of tools that are useful even when working by ones' self, the real value in git is in collaboration. When working in a group project in git (or anywhere, for that matter), it's important to read all documentation related to the project, particularly those relating to the etiquette and conventions of the group. There are generalized READMEs in Github as well as guides for working in <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">jQuery</a> and other specific disciplines. Git projects, particularly on Github also have a specific workflow for contributions. The specifics of each project may be slightly different, but the basic workflow will be similar and consist of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fork the target repository to your account.</li>
                <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
                <li>Check out a new branch and make changes.</li>
                <li>Push your branch to your fork.</li>
                <li>Use the diff viewer on GitHub to create a pull request via discussion.</li>
                <li>Make any requested changes.</li>
                <li>Pull request is merged (usually to the master branch) and topic branch is deleted from the upstream repository.</li>
            </ul>
